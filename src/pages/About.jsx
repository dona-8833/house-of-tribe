          About The House of Tribe
        </h1>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Founded in 2019, The House of Tribe is a contemporary fashion brand
          rooted in Nigerian tradition and designed for the modern world.
          Specializing in elegant Aso-Oke pieces — from statement kimonos and
          tailored sets to bespoke designs — the brand blends heritage,
          artistry, and sophistication to create timeless fashion for both men
          and women.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The House of Tribe was born from the vision of Halimah Badmus, who
          sought to celebrate the beauty of Aso-Oke beyond ceremonial use and
          redefine it as a symbol of cultural pride, elegance, and identity.
          Each piece is crafted not just as clothing but as an art form —
          weaving stories of resilience, tradition, and modern style into every
          thread.

          About Halimah Badmus, Founder &  <br />Creative Director
        </h1>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Halimah Badmus is the founder and creative director of The House of
          Tribe. A Nigerian fashion designer with an eye for detail and a
          passion for cultural storytelling, Halimah creates designs that merge
          traditional weaving techniques with modern silhouettes, offering
          fashion that is both rooted and refined.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          With academic roots in History Education from Adekunle Ajasin
          University, Akungba-Akoko, and a Master’s degree in Early Childhood
          Education from the University of Hull, Halimah made a bold transition
          into fashion — a journey inspired by her mother, herself a fashion
          designer. Growing up in that environment, Halimah developed a natural
          passion and interest in design. Before founding The House of Tribe in
          2019, she worked alongside her mother, supporting her work and
          apprenticing under her to sharpen her craft and develop her skills.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Her signature style is defined by elegance, bold expression, and
          timeless craftsmanship, with each collection paying homage to
          tradition while embracing the modern spirit of fashion. Today, Halimah
          continues to shape The House of Tribe into a brand that empowers both
          men and women to wear their culture with confidence and pride.
